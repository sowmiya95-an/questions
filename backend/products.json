It’s good for those with ageing concerns, as its star ingredient - CoQ-10 - works to boost the skin’s natural repair and defence mechanisms for a smoother complexion over time. It also contains hyaluronic acid (an impressive humectant), which works to help the skin retain much-needed moisture, while soothing aloe vera, chamomile and cucumber keep skin calm and contented. Think of this as a skin-softening precursor to your serum or moisturiser."

In synergy with a 2% concentration amino acid-based humectant, the formula is supercharged with Snow Mushroom (or Tremella Fuciformis), a jelly-like fungus that has been used in Chinese medicines and skincare for millennia. Its gelatinous structure, combined with high levels of polysaccharide molecules, act similarly to Hyaluronic acid, by binding moisture to the skin, but has the capacity to penetrate even deeper thanks to its smaller molecular structure. Enriched with Madecassoside, an active ingredient derived from the Centella Asiatica plant, offers anti-itching and anti-irritation powers to calm redness and sensitivities."

The glycerin acts as a humectant – attracting and retaining water in a bid to supplement cells’ reservoirs – while the Vor-mag water (meaning that the water has been magnetised and ‘vortexed’ to increase its energy and vibration) works in tandem with the healing and mood-elevating rosewater to leave skin feeling supple, soft and ‘springy’. Simply mist over face, hair and scalp to hydrate and rebalance whenever you start to feel fraught."

Rich in linoleic (omega 6) and linolenic (omega 3) acids, alongside pro-vitamin A, the oil targets signs of photo-ageing (premature ageing caused by repeated exposure to ultraviolet radiation) and boosts the skin’s overall health for a radiant result.",
            "largeDes": "The Ordinary’s 100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil is brimming with vitamins, antioxidants and essential fatty acids, which are known to hydrate and promote a smooth, even complexion. To ensure that no one of these is compromised, this formulation is cold-pressed, as any extraction process involving heat causes it to degrade. Rose hip seed oil’s rich quantity of linoleic (omega 6), linolenic (omega 3) acids and pro-vitamin A allow it to target signs of photo-ageing – premature ageing of caused by repeated exposure to ultraviolet radiation. It is also known to correct dark spots, hydrate dry, itchy skin and even reduce scars and fine lines by encouraging cellular regeneration. The Ordinary’s formulation is completely unrefined, leaving it with a natural scent, which is a testament to its purity not (as it may be mistaken for) its rancidity."
